# RouteOptimizer-FastPath
FastPath is a small delivery system made using Python. It helps trucks deliver packages in the shortest and fastest way by checking which cities are connected and how far they are. The program reads the package and city data from files, finds the best routes, sends the trucks, and writes down what happened in a log.
